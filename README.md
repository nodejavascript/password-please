# password-please
The least annoying password generator on the Internet.

## Why?
- I frequently require ENV secrets and when I do, I need many !!!
- I needed continuous one-click, random password generator
- Default 32 characters

## The problem
- But there are several secret generators online ?
- LastPass, lol!
- ads galore...
- cumbersome
- "they" try to convert you into a lead after creating a single password

## The solution
  - click to copy to clipboard
  - generates new password
  - repeat

## Least annoying because:
  - No marketing
  - No advertising
  - No tracking

## Free and open-source software
